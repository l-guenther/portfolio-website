# Clean and simple website template for a portfolio website
This template was created because I wanted to have a portfolio website. Since I am just an engineer I do not need to showcase my web design skills. I just wanted something extremely simple that still would provide responsive behavior without having to worry about javascript (external or internal).

This template is using vanilla bootstrap for the responsive behavior. Just download a current bootstrap.css file and place it in the bootstrap folder (or change the path in the html files to point to where ever you put it). Since there is no javascript the navbar does not collapse to the hamburger menu when the screen size gets to small. Keep that in mind if you want to use the navbar extensively. For my purposes this was not an issue.

If you want to change the color scheme from the default blue there is a scss file included that you can use to change the primary color with SASS. You will need the complete bootstrap download for this to work.
